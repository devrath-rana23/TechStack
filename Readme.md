What it does is instaed of mapping all the items in list as different components and rendering them all together it checks how many items can fit in a screen and make only that number of components for rendering and assign the list items to those fixed number of components on scrolling and renders them so at a time only subset of data is rendered in screen at a time save memory space and increasing performance
